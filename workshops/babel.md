## Babel
### What do we mean when we say that two or more nodes are "meshing" with each other?
For peoplesopen, "these two nodes are meshing" is another way of saying
"these two devices are sharing their routing tables with each other via babeld."
If a device has an IPv4 address within the mesh subnet,
then it can "mesh" with other devices by managing its routing table via Babel.

### How can we watch Babel babble?
Just run `tcpdump -n -i mesh5` on the node!

### Group activity: How does Babel / Bellman-Ford work?
Each participant acts as a node.
Define links between some participants to get a network topology.
Everyone starts with an empty routing table.
...what happens? How are the tables populated?

What happens if we make a change, like breaking a link or adding a link?
